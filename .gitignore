/**
 * This file is the .gitignore file for the project.
 * It specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
 * Ignoring certain files and directories is useful to prevent them from being tracked by version control.
 * This .gitignore file includes patterns for ignoring compiled output, logs, OS-specific files, test coverage, IDE and editor files, and more.
 * By ignoring these files, they will not be included in the Git repository, making the repository cleaner and more focused on the source code.
 * This helps to avoid unnecessary conflicts and reduces the size of the repository.
 * It is recommended to review and customize the .gitignore file based on the specific needs of the project.
